**Navigating the Evolution of Railway Communication: Addressing Current Challenges and Embracing Future Innovations**\
**Etienne Fayt (Alstom, Belgium)**

**Abstract:** In today's railway industry, the demands for communication infrastructure are evolving rapidly alongside the ever-expanding array of applications. Current communication methods, such as GSM-R for ETCS and critical voice, alongside 4G-5G for ATO and passenger information systems, underscore the diversity of requirements within the modern rail ecosystem. However, with this diversity comes the challenge of managing numerous antennas and mitigating interference between different radio systems, a challenge that requires innovative solutions.\
Looking towards the future, the impending obsolescence of GSM-R necessitates a transition towards more advanced communication paradigms. Enter FRMCS, the Future Railway Mobile Communication System, promising enhanced capabilities and flexibility. Yet, the transition from GSM-R to FRMCS presents its own set of challenges, requiring careful navigation to ensure seamless integration and operational continuity.\
In the realm of metro systems, where Communication-Based Train Control (CBTC) and multimedia applications reign supreme, the communication landscape is equally complex. The evolution of communication needs for signaling and multimedia services demands a forward-looking approach. Current radio system architectures, including IEEE802.11 and 4G, are being complemented by future architectures like IEEE802.11ax and 5G, signaling a shift towards higher performance and efficiency.
However, one significant challenge looms large: the coexistence of CBTC radio systems and vehicles within the 5915-5935 MHz frequency band in open-air line sections. This band, mandated by European regulations, must be shared with vehicles equipped with radio ITSG5 (IEEE802.11p) or LTE/5G-V2X systems. Here, the prioritization of CBTC radio systems within the 5915-5925 MHz band adds a layer of complexity that demands innovative solutions and robust coordination efforts.
In this keynote address, we will explore the intricate interplay between evolving communication needs, emerging technologies, and regulatory imperatives within the railway industry. Through insightful discussions and forward-thinking perspectives, we aim to chart a course towards a more connected, efficient, and resilient railway communication infrastructure for the future.

**Potential of Vehicular Opportunistic Networking in Urban Mobility**\
**Takamasa Higuchi (Toyota Motor Corporation, Japan)**

**Abstract:** The increasing network traffic from connected vehicles is putting a strain on the limited bandwidth resources of cellular networks. Vehicular opportunistic networks (OppNets) have been considered an effective means of offloading cellular data traffic, while its quantitative performance in urban road traffic remains unclear in many aspects. This talk will unveil the potential of data offloading over vehicular OppNets by city-scale network simulations in Nagoya, Japan. The results indicate that a significant amount of data traffic can be offloaded to vehicular OppNets even with only 1% or less ratio of vehicles being involved in inver-vehicle communications.

**V2X4Robot: when social robotics meets vehicular communications for a safe and an ethical cooperative automated driving**\
**Alexey Vinel (KIT, Germany)**

**Abstract:** Autonomous vehicles promise to bring enhanced safety on our roads. On the way towards full autonomy, sharing roads between automated vehicles and human actors is unavoidable. Moreover, even if all the vehicles were autonomous, pedestrians would still be crossing the streets. We present an innovative concept of social robot as a moderator between automated vehicles (via vehicular communications) and vulnerable road users (via natural communications). We argue the need for a new vehicular communications protocols design so that the robot could perform both the routine guidance as well as the pre-crash ethical moderation.  

**Bio:** Alexey Vinel is a professor at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Germany. Previously he was a professor at the University of Passau, Germany. Since 2015, he has been a professor at Halmstad University, Sweden (now part-time). He received the Ph.D. degree from the Tampere University of Technology, Finland in 2013. He has been the Senior Member of the IEEE since 2012. His areas of interests include vehicular communications and networking, cooperative driving, future smart mobility solutions.

**Towards Time-sensitive Wireless Networks: Challenges, Opportunities, and Research Directions**\
**Doğanalp Ergenç (Telecommunication Networks (TKN), TU Berlin, Germany)**

**Abstract:** The increasing adoption of wireless networking in modern safety-critical systems, such as industrial automation, automotive, and avionics applications, demands communication technologies handling stringent latency and reliability requirements. While emerging technologies like Wi-Fi 7 and 6G offer promising solutions, ensuring time-sensitive communication over wireless medium remains a significant challenge due to its stochastic nature. In contrast, IEEE 802.1 Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) standards enable deterministic communication through advanced traffic scheduling, configuration, and reliability mechanisms, but they are primarily designed for Ethernet-based wired systems. This talk explores the integration of TSN protocols with wireless technologies, particularly focusing on the combination of TSN and Wi-Fi. The discussion will highlight both the opportunities and the key challenges associated with achieving (near-)deterministic performance in wireless environments and outline potential research directions.

**Bio:** Doğanalp Ergenç is a postdoctoral researcher at Technische Universität Berlin in the Telecommunication Networks Group (TKN). He completed his PhD in 2023 at Universität Hamburg, where he specialized in the resilience of mission-critical systems using IEEE 802.1 Time-Sensitive Networking standards. His current research centers on next-generation resilient and time-sensitive wireless networks. He has worked on several funded research projects in Germany and Turkey and regularly serves as a technical committee member and organizer for conferences such as IEEE RNDM, ICCN, and ICNP. He is also an active member of the IEEE Communications Society (ComSoc)

**Next-Generation Mobility: Latency-First Wireless Mesh Networks**\
**Jonathan Oostvogels (KULeuven, Belgium)**

**Abstract:** Current wireless network technologies break down in applications that demand fast mobility and millisecond-scale latency, for example, in the case of closed-loop control algorithms for automated vehicles that avoid collisions or enable fine-grained manoeuvring. Conversely, swarms of drones flying under a forest canopy may spend most of their time unable to communicate, leaving only millisecond windows in which joint decision making must occur.  Striving for wireless networks that support millisecond-level mobility and latency, we introduce latency-first network design. This approach focuses on establishing fast rather than reliable software interfaces between wireless network components, fundamentally rethinking what each of those components should try to accomplish. We show how this approach leads to a collection of transceiver prototypes and network protocols that, for the first time, enable sub-millisecond data gathering and decision making in multi-hop mesh networks, while maintaining inherent mobility support. We conclude by presenting practical inroads for this foundational research line, such as its integration with mmWave radar platforms found in a vehicular context.

**Bio:** Jonathan Oostvogels is postdoctoral researcher at the DistriNet research group of the Department of Computer Science, KU Leuven. In 2025, he obtained his PhD at KU Leuven summa cum laude, and was awarded with a postdoctoral research fellowship by the Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO). He is part-time visiting researcher at Inria Paris, where he is collaborating with the AIO team led by Thomas Watteyne.
